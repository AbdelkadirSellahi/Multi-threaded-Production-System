# Multi-threaded Production Line Simulation

This project simulates a multi-threaded production line using semaphores for synchronization. It models a scenario where multiple producers create batteries and motherboards, which are then used to assemble computers. The simulation demonstrates the use of pthreads and semaphores in a C program to manage concurrent operations and resource sharing among threads.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- ### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you will need:

- GCC compiler
- POSIX threads library
- POSIX semaphores

Most Unix-like operating systems come with these pre-installed. You can verify the presence of GCC by running `gcc --version` in your terminal.

- ### Installing

To get the project running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `git clone <repository-url>`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   `cd <project-directory>`
   
3. Compile the project using GCC:

   `gcc -o production_line_simulation main.c -lpthread`

   This will generate an executable named `production_line_simulation`.

4. Run the simulation:

   `./production_line_simulation`
